### 👋 Hi there, I'm Bo Koehler!

I'm a 15-year-old aspiring web developer with a passion for coding, gaming, and creating. Here's a bit about me:

- 🚀 I'm currently a beginner dev for websites, and I love working with CSS and HTML to create buttons with cool animations.
- 🐍 I'm an avid Python enthusiast, and I enjoy crafting Discord bots using this versatile language.
- 🌐 I'm always on the lookout for inspiration, whether it's in code or design. I often browse CodePen for creative ideas.
