### 👋 Hi there, I'm Bo Koehler!

I'm a 15-year-old aspiring fullstack developer with a passion for coding, gaming, and creating. Here's a bit about me:

- 🚀 I'm currently a beginner fullstack dev for websites, and I love working with CSS and HTML to create buttons with cool animations.
- 🐍 I'm an avid Python enthusiast, and I enjoy crafting Discord bots using this versatile language.
- 🎮 When I'm not coding, you can usually find me in the gaming world. I'm a fan of CS:GO, Valorant, Assetto Corsa, Minecraft, Terraria, and many other games.
- 🎥 I'm also into content creation, and I have a YouTube video with 1.7 Million views! I enjoy streaming and video editing.
- 🌐 I'm always on the lookout for inspiration, whether it's in code or design. I often browse CodePen for creative ideas.

In addition to all this, I have a fascination with war history, particularly the WW1, WW2, Cold War, and Vietnam War eras. I'm also intrigued by the technology, weapons, and vehicles from those times. Fighter jets like the F22 Raptor and the Porsche 992 are some of my favorite things!

Feel free to connect with me, collaborate on Python projects, or just chat about coding and gaming. Let's make the tech world more exciting together!
